# Check-In Map with Django, Angular Google Maps, and geopy

## Description
This is a barebones application built with Django which would allow a person to add where they have been and create a note. It would be an ideal tutorial and example to get hints or learn from for anyone who is interested in creating their own web application with the need to map out coordinates from a database onto a Google Map.  

Whatever you do, this wasn't built for deployment on a production server. Should you take the risk, you do so at your own peril!   

## Relevant Modules/Plugins

1. geopy 
2. Angular Google Maps
3. Django Rest Framework
4. PyMySQL - This was built to use a MySQL database management system. I could do a separate tutorial using PostgreSQL for those who are interested. 

## Notes

1. To get it working on your machine, ensure you have your virtual environment up an running. 
2. I used a MAMP server on my system. You will have to make changes to the settings.py file if you are using LAMP or WAMP.
